          Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br/>
          I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br/>
          The evil that men do lives after them;<br/>
          The good is oft interred with their bones;<br/>
          So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br/>
          Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br/>
          If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br/>
          And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.<br/>
          Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–<br/>
          For Brutus is an honourable man;<br/>
          So are they all, all honourable men–<br/>
          Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.<br/>
          He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br/>
          But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br/>
          And Brutus is an honourable man.<br/>
          He hath brought many captives home to Rome<br/>
          Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br/>
          Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br/>
          When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<br/>
          Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br/>
          Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br/>
          And Brutus is an honourable man.<br/>
          You all did see that on the Lupercal<br/>
          I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br/>
          Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br/>
          Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br/>
          And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br/>
          I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br/>
          But here I am to speak what I do know.<br/>
          You all did love him once, not without cause:<br/>
          What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<br/>
          O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br/>
          And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br/>
          My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br/>
          And I must pause till it come back to me.<br/>
